# Welcome to the ARGOS Ontology Publication

### Access Realignment using Graph-based Ontological Semantics

The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as natural language interfaces for relational databases (RDBs) is rapidly advancing. However, the practical application of RDB-backed agents is hindered by legacy access control mechanisms that do not fully support the semantic expressiveness and dynamic query generation capabilities of LLMs.

To resolve these shortcomings, we propose **ARGOS**, a novel symbolic access control framework tailored for LLM-RDB integration. The ARGOS framework intercepts LLM queries and uses a symbolic reasoner that employs this novel ontology to accurately infer the access alignment of each data reference based on the agent's assigned data access policies. Instead of merely rejecting a query that violates a data access policy, ARGOS performs automatic query realignment to comply with the agent's data access rights, preserving user intent while guaranteeing access-level security.
